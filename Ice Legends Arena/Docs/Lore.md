## **🌍 Core Story Concept**

### **The Premise**

In an alternate universe, a group of aliens visit Earth. They are all from the same species but have slightly different abilities. The aliens ask to speak with Earth's leaders to discuss Earth's surrender. During their meeting, a hockey game plays in the background. Confusing the game for war, one of the alien generals challenges the human leader. Realizing this would probably be a game to the death (his death), he suggests they gather Earth's best athletes to compete in "battle."

However, in this universe, Earth has a race of humans with incredible abilities. While most of these people have horrible deformities, others look as normal as you or me (except for their eyes… you can always tell a mutant from their eyes). These people, known as Mutants, were the product of the Thousand Year War—which ended with both nations' capitals being doused with toxic chemicals that killed millions instantly and transformed a small percent of the population into something else. The surrounding cities and wildlife were also changed, as the toxic waste ran through the water and land.

These special people—"Mutants"—gave Earth the strength to win. But this was just the beginning, as this was only one race of alien that only had a month to train. Quickly, word spread throughout the galaxy of a new game. First spreading along the galactic silk road, often passed along by merchants and bounty hunters to pass time. As merchants passed through war-torn solar systems, soldiers picked up the game and would play on passing comets. Soon the sport spread to larger cities when soldiers returned home. Then real athletes started to train and compete.

Over the next 100 years, the game grew in popularity and the legend of the Mutants grew larger than life—giving rise to the **Mutant Hockey Federation (MHF)**. And to celebrate the 100th year anniversary, they decided to visit Earth for a rematch.

### **The Stakes**

In this universe, war drove humanity to create more advanced technology than we have today. So it's not uncommon for people to live to 150\. While the mutants who originally played that legendary game are still alive, they are in no playing shape. Instead, they became coaches, trainers, equipment CEOs, and team owners—giving Earth the firepower and skill they'll need to compete in this new league and save Earth from doom.

**If Earth loses: Alien occupation.**  
 **If Earth wins: Freedom for another 100 years.**

## **👁️ Visual Identity System: The Mutant "Tell"**

### **Primary Identifier: GLOWING EYES**

**"You can always tell a mutant from their eyes."**

Every mutant has luminescent eyes that glow with their mutation energy. This serves as both a lore element and a gameplay clarity feature.

**Eye Colors by Archetype:**

* **Pyro:** Orange/Red glow with ember flicker  
* **Flux:** Purple/Blue shimmer with clock-like pupils  
* **Rage:** Crimson/Blood red with visible veins  
* **Phantom:** Silver/White with ghost after-image  
* **Bulwark:** Gold/Yellow with hexagonal pattern  
* **Hive:** Green/Toxic with multiple pupils  
* **Ricochet:** Electric blue with geometric patterns  
* **Morph:** Shifting rainbow/chromatic

**Gameplay Benefits:**

* ✅ Instant character identification at distance  
* ✅ Team composition visible at a glance  
* ✅ Color-coded abilities (red eyes \= fire attacks)  
* ✅ Accessibility for colorblind players (each has unique pattern)

### **Secondary Mutations: Scalable Complexity**

Mutation severity scales with character rarity/skin tier, allowing art complexity to grow over time.

**Common Tier (Launch Characters):**

* Glowing eyes (primary identifier)  
* Subtle skin discoloration  
* Minor physical tells (ex: Rage has visible veins, Hive has green undertones)  
* Mostly human appearance

**Rare Tier (Early Skins):**

* Enhanced eye effects (glow intensity, particle effects)  
* Minor deformities (extra finger, small tail, pointed ears)  
* Textured skin (scales, ridges, bioluminescent patterns)  
* 80% human appearance

**Epic Tier (Mid-Season Skins):**

* Visible mutations (glowing veins throughout body, crystalline growths)  
* Moderate deformities (elongated limbs, bone protrusions)  
* Elemental auras matching archetype  
* 60% human appearance

**Legendary Tier (Premium Skins):**

* Extreme transformations (monstrous, fully mutated)  
* Animated mutation effects (Pyro's body flickers with flame)  
* Full creature design while maintaining hockey gear  
* 30% human appearance (recognizable silhouette only)

**Art Direction Philosophy:** "Start simple, scale complexity. Every mutant should be identifiable by silhouette and eye color alone."

## **🏒 League Structure: The Mutant Hockey Federation**

### **Earth Division**

**8 Regional Teams** (corresponding to the 8 mutation zones from the Thousand Year War):

6. **Cairo Pharaohs** (North Africa/Middle East)  
7. **Sydney Thunder** (Oceania)

Each team drafts mutants from their local population. Team colors and mascots reflect regional culture mixed with post-war aesthetics.

### **Galactic Conference**

## **📈 Character Progression & Roster Expansion**

### **Launch Roster (8 Characters)**

* 1 character per archetype  
* Covers all positions:  
  * 2 pure Forwards (Pyro, Phantom)  
  * 2 Centers (Flux, Ricochet)  
  * 2 Defensemen (Bulwark, Rage)  
  * 2 Flex/Support (Hive, Morph)  
* All 8 earnable through free play  
* Balanced on release (no character \= auto-win)

### **Season Updates (Every 10 Weeks)**

Each season adds **3 new characters** as variants of existing archetypes.

**Example \- Season 1: "The Second Generation"**

* Inferno (Pyro variant) \- Fire wall specialist  
* Ghost (Phantom variant) \- Can phase through players  
* Guardian (Bulwark variant) \- Mobile shield bubble

**Example \- Season 2: "The Extremes"**

* Ember (Pyro variant) \- Delayed explosion specialist  
* Swarm (Hive variant) \- Many small creatures  
* Fastforward (Flux variant) \- Prediction-based offense

**Year 1 Goal:** 20+ characters (8 launch \+ 12 seasonal)

### **Archetype Balance System**

Since all characters fall into 8 archetypes, balance is maintained by:

* ✅ Each archetype has same core strengths/weaknesses  
* ✅ Variants modify playstyle, not power level  
* ✅ New releases can't create new meta (archetype already exists)  
* ✅ Buffs/nerfs affect archetype, not individual characters

**Example:** If Pyro archetype is too strong:

* Nerf affects Blaze, Inferno, AND Ember equally  
* Maintains archetype identity while preserving balance

Every dollar spent \= direct value received, no gambling required.

## **🎯 Closing Philosophy**

**Mutant Hockey Federation is built on three pillars:**

1. **Unique IP** \- Nobody else has dystopian mutant sports. This is OUR story.  
2. **Player-First Monetization** \- Free players are respected. Paying players get convenience and cosmetics, not wins.  
3. **Franchise Vision** \- This isn't just one game. It's the foundation of a sports gaming universe.

**Every decision should be measured against these pillars.**

If a feature doesn't serve the IP, respect the player, or build toward the franchise... cut it.
